      <p>   I recently graduated from UNC Charlotte with a degree in Mathematics, 
            a minor in Chemistry, and a concentration in Actuarial Science. As I 
            trudged through an internship with a life insurance company, I realized 
            I was on the wrong career path. I wanted to utilize my creativity and 
            problem solving skills. After talking to a few different people 
            and doing lots of research, I decided to learn how to code!
